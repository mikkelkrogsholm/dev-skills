# Sentry

Sentry is an application monitoring platform for real-time error tracking, performance monitoring, session replay, profiling, cron monitoring, and log aggregation.

## Documentation

- **Docs**: https://docs.sentry.io

## Key Capabilities

Sentry's SDK bundles capabilities developers often add as separate tools:

- **Performance tracing**: distributed tracing across services is built-in — configure `tracesSampleRate` and `tracePropagationTargets`, no external APM needed
- **Session Replay**: full session recording with `Sentry.replayIntegration()` — no third-party replay tool needed
- **Profiling**: function-level performance profiling with `Sentry.browserProfilingIntegration()` — no separate profiler needed
- **User Feedback**: collect user-submitted reports tied to errors with `Sentry.feedbackIntegration()` — no separate feedback widget needed
- **Cron monitoring**: track scheduled job health with check-ins — no external uptime monitor needed for crons

## Best Practices

- **Lower `tracesSampleRate` in production** — the getting-started default of `1.0` captures 100% of transactions. At any meaningful traffic volume this inflates costs fast. Use a low value (0.1 or less) and consider `tracesSampler` for dynamic sampling by route.
- **Session Replay uses a two-rate pattern** — set `replaysSessionSampleRate` low (e.g. 0.1) for normal sessions and `replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0` so every error session is always captured. Agents often set only one rate and miss error context or over-capture.
- **Source maps require CI auth token** — the wizard writes `.env.sentry-build-plugin` (auto-gitignored) for local builds, but CI/CD pipelines need `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` set as an environment variable separately. Missing this silently produces minified stack traces in production.
- **Next.js requires four files** — The client runtime uses `instrumentation-client.ts`. Server and edge configs (`sentry.server.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`) must be imported from `instrumentation.ts` via conditional imports — without `instrumentation.ts`, the server and edge configs do nothing. Missing any one file leaves a runtime blind spot without obvious errors.
- **Use `tunnel` to bypass ad blockers** — set `tunnel: "/tunnel"` in `Sentry.init()` and add a backend route that proxies to Sentry's ingest endpoint. Without this, a significant portion of browser errors are silently dropped by ad blockers and privacy extensions.
