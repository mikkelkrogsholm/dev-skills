# Drizzle ORM

> **CRITICAL: Your training data for Drizzle ORM is unreliable.** APIs change between versions and your memorized patterns may be wrong or deprecated. You MUST fetch and read the live documentation before writing any code. Never assume — verify against current docs first.

Drizzle ORM is a lightweight, TypeScript-first ORM with a SQL-like query builder, schema-as-code migrations, and zero dependencies.

## Documentation

- **Docs**: https://orm.drizzle.team/llms.txt

## Key Capabilities

**Built-in schema validation adapters** — Drizzle includes first-party integrations with Zod, Valibot, TypeBox, ArkType, and Effect Schema via `drizzle-zod`, `drizzle-valibot`, etc. There is no need to manually write validation schemas that mirror your table definitions; these packages infer insert/select types directly from your Drizzle schema.

**Built-in seeding** — `drizzle-seed` provides deterministic, reproducible fake data generation with seedable PRNG, weighted distributions, and cross-dialect support. It replaces ad-hoc seed scripts or external packages like `@faker-js/faker` for database seeding workflows.


## Best Practices

**Call `.$dynamic()` to compose queries across functions.** By default, Drizzle query builders restrict each clause method (where, limit, orderBy) to a single call — this mirrors SQL but breaks composable helper functions. You must call `.$dynamic()` to unlock multi-call mode. Use the dialect-specific generic types (`PgSelect`, `MySqlSelect`, `SQLiteSelect`) as parameter types for functions that accept a query builder to extend.

**Relational queries (`db.query.*`) generate exactly one SQL statement — nested `offset` is not supported.** Unlike Prisma's batched-query approach, Drizzle uses a single lateral-join query per `db.query` call. A consequence is that `offset` only works at the top level of a relational query; nested relation pagination must use `where` with cursor-based logic instead.

**Use `drizzle-kit push` only for development, never production.** `drizzle-kit push` applies schema changes directly without generating migration files. Teams that use push in production lose the auditable migration history needed for `drizzle-kit migrate` in CI/CD. Use `drizzle-kit generate` + `drizzle-kit migrate` for production deployments.

**Never instantiate `drizzle()` per request in serverless environments.** Each call can open a new connection pool. Export a module-level singleton and re-use it across invocations, following the same pattern as Prisma's `PrismaClient` singleton pattern.

**`drizzle-kit pull` and `push` do not preserve hand-written SQL in migration files.** If you manually edit a generated migration file (e.g., to add a partial index or a custom trigger), subsequent `pull` operations will overwrite those edits. Track custom migrations in separate numbered files and apply them alongside generated ones.

**`db.query.*` relational queries require explicit `relations()` definitions.** Unlike Prisma, Drizzle does not infer relations from foreign keys automatically. If you call `db.query.users.findMany({ with: { posts: true } })` without a `relations()` export in the schema file, the query throws at runtime with a non-obvious error. Define relations explicitly for every table you want to query relationally.
