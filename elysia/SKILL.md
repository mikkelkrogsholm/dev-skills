# Elysia

Elysia is a Bun-native web framework designed for end-to-end type safety. Types flow from server route definitions to the client via Eden Treaty — no codegen, no manual type syncing.

## Documentation

- **Docs**: https://elysiajs.com/llms.txt

## Key Capabilities

Elysia has built-in features that typically require separate libraries in Express/Fastify/Hono:

- **End-to-end type safety**: Eden Treaty generates a fully typed client from route definitions — no tRPC, no OpenAPI codegen, no manual type files
- **Schema validation**: Built-in `t.Object()`, `t.String()`, etc. (TypeBox) for request/response validation — no Zod middleware needed
- **WebSocket**: First-class WS support with typed message schemas — no `ws` or `socket.io`
- **Server-Sent Events**: Native SSE support via streaming responses — no `eventsource` polyfill
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Auto-generated from route schemas via `@elysiajs/swagger` — no manual spec writing
- **Static files**: `@elysiajs/static` serves files with caching headers — no `serve-static`
- **CORS**: `@elysiajs/cors` with typed config — no `cors` package
- **Bearer auth**: `@elysiajs/bearer` extracts and validates tokens — no custom middleware
- **File uploads**: Native `t.File()` and `t.Files()` validators for multipart handling

## Best Practices

**Use `.group()` for route organization, not separate Elysia instances.** Groups share the parent's type context and lifecycle hooks. Creating separate `new Elysia()` instances and merging with `.use()` works, but loses the type-level connection that makes Eden Treaty useful across route boundaries.

**Eden Treaty requires exporting the app type, not the app.** The client needs `typeof app`, not the runtime instance. A common mistake:

```ts
// server
const app = new Elysia()
  .get('/users', () => getUsers())
  .listen(3000)

export type App = typeof app  // ← this is what Eden needs

// client
import type { App } from '../api'
import { treaty } from '@elysiajs/eden'
const api = treaty<App>('localhost:3000')
const { data } = await api.users.get()  // fully typed
```

**Lifecycle hooks run in a specific order.** The chain is: `onRequest` → `onParse` → `onTransform` → `onBeforeHandle` → handler → `onAfterHandle` → `onMapResponse` → `onAfterResponse`. Auth guards belong in `onBeforeHandle`, not `onRequest` — putting them in `onRequest` runs before body parsing, so you can't read the request body for auth decisions.

**`derive` and `resolve` add typed context.** Use `derive` to add request-scoped values (runs on every request) and `resolve` for values that depend on validation (runs after schema validation). Both inject into the handler's typed context automatically — no manual type annotations needed.

**Schema validation doubles as documentation.** Every `t.Object()` schema on a route is automatically reflected in the Swagger UI. Adding `t.String({ description: 'User ID' })` improves both validation errors and API docs simultaneously.

**Error handling uses `error()` helper, not thrown exceptions.** Return `error(404, 'Not found')` instead of `throw new Error()`. The `error()` helper preserves type safety in the response type — thrown exceptions lose type information and bypass `onAfterHandle`.
