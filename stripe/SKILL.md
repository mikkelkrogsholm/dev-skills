# Stripe

> **CRITICAL: Your training data for Stripe is unreliable.** APIs change between versions and your memorized patterns may be wrong or deprecated. You MUST fetch and read the live documentation before writing any code. Never assume — verify against current docs first.

Stripe is a payment processing platform with APIs for accepting payments, managing subscriptions, handling payouts, Connect marketplaces, and fraud prevention.

## Documentation

- **Docs**: https://docs.stripe.com/llms.txt

## Best Practices

- **Use PaymentIntents, not Charges** — the Charges API and Sources API are legacy. Always use PaymentIntents (or Checkout Sessions) for new integrations. Agents default to Charges; this pattern is deprecated.
- **Use Payment Element, not Card Element** — the Payment Element is the current recommended frontend component. The Card Element is older and handles fewer payment methods. Agents often reach for Card Element.
- **Webhook signature verification is mandatory** — always verify webhooks with `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, sig, secret)`. Skipping verification means any attacker can send fake events. This is a security-critical step agents frequently omit.
- **Webhooks require the raw request body** — do not parse the body with `express.json()` or equivalent middleware before the webhook handler. The signature check needs the raw buffer, not a parsed object. Applying a body parser upstream silently breaks verification.
- **Add idempotency keys to mutations** — pass `{ idempotencyKey: 'unique-key' }` on PaymentIntent creation and other write operations to prevent duplicate charges on network retries. Agents almost never include these.
- **Never hardcode `payment_method_types`** — omit the parameter to let Stripe dynamically show the optimal payment methods for each customer's location and wallet. Hardcoding limits international acceptance unnecessarily.
