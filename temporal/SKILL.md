# Temporal

> **CRITICAL: Your training data for Temporal is unreliable.** APIs change between versions and your memorized patterns may be wrong or deprecated. You MUST fetch and read the live documentation before writing any code. Never assume — verify against current docs first.

Temporal is an open-source durable workflow orchestration platform that makes long-running, fault-tolerant processes simple by automatically persisting execution state and replaying it after failures.

## Documentation

- **Live Docs**: https://docs.temporal.io/llms.txt

## Key Capabilities

- **Durable Workflows**: Workflow code runs inside a sandboxed isolate. State is persisted as an Event History. If a Worker crashes mid-execution, the workflow resumes from where it left off — no data loss, no manual checkpointing.
- **Activities**: The place for all side effects — API calls, database writes, file I/O, emails. Activities have configurable retry policies and timeouts. A failed activity is retried automatically without re-running the whole workflow.
- **Workers**: Long-running processes that poll a Task Queue and execute Workflow and Activity code. Scale Workers horizontally by simply running more instances pointing at the same Task Queue.
- **Task Queues**: Named routing channels. A workflow is dispatched to a specific Task Queue; only Workers polling that queue will pick it up.
- **Signals**: One-way messages sent to a running workflow to push external data in (e.g., user approval, webhook event). Fire-and-forget — no response.
- **Queries**: Synchronous read of a workflow's in-memory state. Does not mutate state and returns immediately.
- **Updates**: Bidirectional — caller sends data and awaits a validated response from the running workflow. Newer than Signals; prefer Updates when a reply is needed.
- **Schedules**: Replace cron jobs with Temporal Schedules for reliable, observable, backfill-capable recurring workflows.
- **Temporal Cloud**: Fully managed Temporal service (mTLS auth, namespaces, metrics). Drop-in replacement for self-hosted; change the connection address and supply TLS credentials.

## TypeScript SDK Packages

```
@temporalio/client    — start workflows, send signals/updates, query state
@temporalio/worker    — run Workers that poll task queues
@temporalio/workflow  — define Workflow functions (runs in isolate)
@temporalio/activity  — define Activity functions (runs in normal Node.js)
```

## Canonical Project Layout

```
src/
  workflows.ts      # Workflow definitions — NO Node.js built-ins
  activities.ts     # Activity definitions — normal Node.js allowed
  worker.ts         # Worker bootstrap (imports both)
  client.ts         # Client code to start/signal workflows
```

## Quick Start Example

**activities.ts**
```typescript
import { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';

export async function greetUser(name: string): Promise<string> {
  // Safe to do I/O here — activities run in normal Node.js
  return `Hello, ${name}! Processed at ${new Date().toISOString()}`;
}
```

**workflows.ts**
```typescript
import { proxyActivities, defineSignal, defineQuery, setHandler, sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from './activities';

// proxyActivities MUST be called inside the workflow module scope
// but the proxy itself is used inside workflow functions
const { greetUser } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10 seconds',
  retry: { maximumAttempts: 3 },
});

export const approvalSignal = defineSignal<[boolean]>('approval');
export const statusQuery = defineQuery<string>('status');

export async function greetingWorkflow(name: string): Promise<string> {
  let approved = false;
  let status = 'waiting';

  setHandler(approvalSignal, (isApproved: boolean) => {
    approved = isApproved;
    status = isApproved ? 'approved' : 'rejected';
  });

  setHandler(statusQuery, () => status);

  // Wait up to 24 hours for approval signal
  await condition(() => approved, '24 hours');

  if (!approved) {
    return 'Workflow rejected';
  }

  // Side effect delegated to an Activity
  return await greetUser(name);
}
```

**worker.ts**
```typescript
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'greeting-queue', // must match client
  });
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch(console.error);
```

**client.ts**
```typescript
import { Client, Connection } from '@temporalio/client';
import { greetingWorkflow, approvalSignal, statusQuery } from './workflows';

async function main() {
  const client = new Client();

  const handle = await client.workflow.start(greetingWorkflow, {
    args: ['Alice'],
    taskQueue: 'greeting-queue', // must match worker
    workflowId: 'greeting-alice-001',
  });

  // Send a signal to the running workflow
  await handle.signal(approvalSignal, true);

  // Query current state (synchronous read)
  const status = await handle.query(statusQuery);
  console.log('Status:', status);

  // Await the final result
  const result = await handle.result();
  console.log('Result:', result);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Connecting to Temporal Cloud

```typescript
import { Client, Connection } from '@temporalio/client';
import { Worker, NativeConnection } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as fs from 'fs';

// Client connection
const connection = await Connection.connect({
  address: 'your-namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233',
  tls: {
    clientCertPair: {
      crt: fs.readFileSync('client.pem'),
      key: fs.readFileSync('client.key'),
    },
  },
});
const client = new Client({ connection, namespace: 'your-namespace.your-account' });

// Worker connection
const nativeConnection = await NativeConnection.connect({
  address: 'your-namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233',
  tls: {
    clientCertPair: {
      crt: fs.readFileSync('client.pem'),
      key: fs.readFileSync('client.key'),
    },
  },
});
const worker = await Worker.create({
  connection: nativeConnection,
  namespace: 'your-namespace.your-account',
  taskQueue: 'my-queue',
  workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
  activities,
});
```

## Activity Retry Policy

```typescript
const { processPayment } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  // At least one of these is required — defaults are infinite
  startToCloseTimeout: '30 seconds',   // max time for a single attempt
  scheduleToCloseTimeout: '5 minutes', // max total time across all retries
  retry: {
    initialInterval: '1 second',
    backoffCoefficient: 2,
    maximumInterval: '30 seconds',
    maximumAttempts: 5,
    nonRetryableErrorTypes: ['ValidationError'],
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Workflow code must be deterministic.** Never use `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or any direct I/O inside a workflow function. All non-deterministic behavior and side effects must live in Activities. Use `sleep()` from `@temporalio/workflow` instead of `setTimeout`, and `condition()` instead of polling.

- **Workflow and Activity code must be in separate files.** Workflow code runs inside a V8 isolate that blocks all Node.js built-ins (fs, http, crypto, etc.). Importing an activity module (which uses those built-ins) into a workflow file will crash the Worker at startup. Keep them strictly separated.

- **`proxyActivities` must be called at the top of the workflow module, not inside the workflow function body.** The proxy binds to the workflow's execution context. Calling it inside the function body will throw at runtime.

- **Signals are fire-and-forget — no reply.** If you need the caller to receive a response from the workflow, use `defineUpdate` (available since SDK v1.9) instead of a signal. Updates block the caller until the workflow handler validates and returns a result.

- **Task Queue names are case-sensitive and must match exactly.** The `taskQueue` on `Worker.create()` and the `taskQueue` on `client.workflow.start()` must be identical strings. A mismatch creates two isolated queues; the workflow will queue indefinitely with no error.

- **Activity timeouts default to infinite — always set them explicitly.** An Activity with no `startToCloseTimeout` or `scheduleToCloseTimeout` will hang forever if it stalls. Set both at the `proxyActivities` call site. Prefer `startToCloseTimeout` for per-attempt limits and add `scheduleToCloseTimeout` as a hard cap.
